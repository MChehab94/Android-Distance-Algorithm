This is a simple project that calculates the distance between two points A and B using one of the following algorithms:
* Euclidean distance
* Manhatten distance
* Minkowski's distance

Note that the user selects which algorithm to use.  
There are two modules in this project:
* app: Java implementation
* kotlin: Kotlin implementation
